it probably makes more sense for the syngas to be directly ignited, rather than sent through a generator, to provide heat for dehydration before pyrolysis

## napkin math
900kg hemp per hectare per season*\
400kg of biochar produced by pyrolyzing it\
200kg of carbon in that biochar\
10000kg rough personal annual carbon footprint\
âˆ´ 50 hecares, or 120 acres needed to offset \

900kg/ha probably involves irrigation and/or fertilizer so might be half that without
